## Common Issues

### Authentication Errors

**Problem:** "Invalid API key" or "Unauthorized" errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check that the key hasn't been revoked
3. Ensure you're using the correct header format:
   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
   ```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="tip">
Test your API key using our [API playground](https://dashboard.maxim-ai.com/playground) before implementing in code.
</Callout>

### Rate Limiting

**Problem:** "Rate limit exceeded" errors

**Solution:**
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Upgrade your plan for higher limits
- Use batch requests to optimize API calls
- Cache responses when appropriate

Example retry logic:
```python
import time
from maxim_ai import MaximAI, RateLimitError

def make_request_with_retry(client, **kwargs):
    max_retries = 3
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return client.chat.complete(**kwargs)
        except RateLimitError:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            wait_time = 2 ** attempt
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### Timeout Errors

**Problem:** Requests timing out

**Solution:**
1. Increase timeout settings in your client
2. Use streaming for long responses
3. Reduce max_tokens parameter
4. Check your network connection

```python
client = MaximAI(
    api_key="your_key",
    timeout=60.0  # Increase timeout to 60 seconds
)
```

### Model Response Quality

**Problem:** Unsatisfactory or inconsistent responses

**Solution:**
1. **Improve prompts:** Be specific and provide context
2. **Adjust temperature:** Lower (0.1-0.5) for consistent, higher (0.7-1.0) for creative
3. **Use system messages:** Set clear instructions
4. **Try different models:** Each model has strengths

Good prompt example:
```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant. Provide clear, well-commented code examples."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers with memoization."
    }
]
```

## Error Codes Reference

| Code | Error | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid request format |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| 403 | Forbidden | Access denied to resource |
| 404 | Not Found | Endpoint or model not found |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Server-side issue |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Temporary outage |

## Performance Optimization

### Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate models**
   - Maxim-Fast for simple tasks
   - Maxim-1 for complex reasoning

2. **Optimize token usage**
   - Keep prompts concise
   - Use system messages efficiently
   - Set reasonable max_tokens limits

3. **Implement caching**
   - Cache frequently requested completions
   - Use embeddings for semantic search

4. **Batch requests**
   - Group multiple requests when possible
   - Reduces API overhead

### Monitoring & Debugging

Enable debug logging:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
client = MaximAI(api_key="your_key")
```

Track performance metrics:
- Response time
- Token usage
- Error rates
- Success rates
