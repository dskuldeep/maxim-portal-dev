## API Security Best Practices

### Secure API Key Management

<Callout type="warning">
Never expose your API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or shared environments.
</Callout>

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export MAXIM_AI_API_KEY="sk-..."
   ```

2. **Rotate Keys Regularly**
   - Rotate every 90 days minimum
   - Immediately rotate if compromised
   - Use multiple keys for different environments

3. **Implement Key Restrictions**
   - IP allowlisting
   - Rate limiting per key
   - Scope limitations (read-only, specific models)

4. **Use Secrets Management**
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Google Secret Manager

### Request Authentication

All API requests must include authentication:

```bash
curl https://api.maxim-ai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAXIM_AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Audit Logs

Enterprise customers get detailed audit logs:
- All API requests and responses
- Authentication attempts
- Configuration changes
- User actions
- Export capabilities for SIEM integration

## Content Filtering & Safety

### Input Filtering

Maxim AI automatically filters:
- Harmful or illegal content
- Personal identifiable information (PII) detection
- Profanity and hate speech
- Malware and phishing attempts

### Output Moderation

Control AI-generated content:
```python
response = client.chat.complete(
    model="maxim-1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}],
    safety_settings={
        "hate": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE",
        "harassment": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE",
        "sexual": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE",
        "dangerous": "BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"
    }
)
```

### Customize Filters

Enterprise customers can:
- Define custom content policies
- Whitelist/blacklist specific content
- Configure industry-specific filters
- Implement custom moderation workflows
