## Billing FAQ

### How is usage calculated?

Usage is measured in tokens:
- **Input tokens:** Text you send to the API
- **Output tokens:** Text generated by the model
- **1 token ≈ 4 characters** or 0.75 words in English

Example:
```
Input: "Hello, how are you?" (5 tokens)
Output: "I'm doing great, thanks for asking!" (8 tokens)
Total: 13 tokens
```
